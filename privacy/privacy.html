The To-Do App (referred to as "we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of its users (referred to as "you" or "your"). This Privacy Policy outlines our practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our website or application (collectively, the "Service").

Information We Do Not Collect

We want to assure you that we do not collect any personal data or sensitive information from you while using the To-Do App. We designed the application with a privacy-first approach, ensuring that all tasks and data you create or input within the app stay exclusively on your local device and are not transmitted to any external servers.

Data Storage and Security

All data and tasks you create or manage using the To-Do App are stored locally on your device. We do not store, access, or sync this information to any cloud-based servers or external databases. Your data remains within the confines of your personal device, providing an added layer of privacy and security.

We take the security of your data seriously and regularly update the To-Do App to maintain a secure environment. However, as the data resides solely on your device, it is essential to keep your device and associated accounts protected with strong passwords and security measures to ensure the safety of your data.

External Links

The To-Do App may contain links to external websites or services that are not operated by us. Please note that we have no control over the content and practices of these third-party websites. Therefore, we encourage you to review the Privacy Policies of these websites before providing any personal information.

Children's Privacy

The To-Do App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and we will take steps to remove such information from our systems.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any significant changes to this Privacy Policy by posting the updated policy on this page.

Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at mehmetkahyakas5@gmail.com 

By using the To-Do App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.
